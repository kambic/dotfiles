GNU **Stow** is a powerful and lightweight symlink manager for managing dotfiles (and beyond). When used well, it makes your setup clean, modular, and portable. Below are **Stow tips, tricks, and a breakdown of the `adopt` feature**, which is very useful for migrating existing configs.

## ðŸš€ Stow Tips & Tricks


```bash
stow bash zsh config local
```
### âœ… 2. **Dry Run First**

Before committing changes:

```bash
stow -nv bash
```

Flags:

* `-n`: donâ€™t actually make changes (dry run)
* `-v`: verbose output

Good for verifying what will happen **before** it does.

### âœ… 3. **Unstow to Remove**

To remove the links created by `stow`:

```bash
stow -D bash
```

It safely removes symlinks **only if they match** the ones stowed before.

---

### âœ… 4. **Target Other Directories**

By default, Stow targets `$HOME`, but you can change it:

```bash
stow -t ~/.config config
```

Useful if you're only managing `.config` and want more control.

---

### âœ… 5. **Force Overwrites**

If a file already exists at the target, Stow will skip or complain.

You can **force overwrite**:

```bash
stow --override='*' --restow bash
```

This replaces existing conflicting files with symlinks.
